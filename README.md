# Learning How to Work With 2D Sprites in Unity

This is a repository of what I've learned while taking a course on LinkedInLearning titled "Learning 2D Sprites" By Jesse Freeman.

Here I learned how to create game objects, use the 2D camera, use and optimize sprites including removing texture compression, cut up sprite sheets, work with sprite animations, and created a basic C# script that swaps between the player's idle animation state and his running animation state.
